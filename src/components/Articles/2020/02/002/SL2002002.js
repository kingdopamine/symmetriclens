                <p><a href="/search?q=barbour">Barbour</a> and <a href="/search?q=engineered+garments">Engineered Garments</a> have come together to create a small capsule collection for Spring Summer 2020.

                <br/><br/>All jackets are either in navy, camo-green, military green, or khaki. Featuring several Anoraks, Blazers, and Parkas, which have been processed to give the jackets a vintage patina and oxidised metal hardware.
                
                <br/><br/>Within the collection is the Warby jacket, retailing at Â£399, it is based on the classic Barbour Longshoreman smock. Made shorter than the original, it is produced with 6oz waxed cotton, and features raglan sleeves, and an adjustable hood.
                
                <br/><br/>Check out the full collection in detail or purchase a piece from the collection <a href="https://www.barbour.com/uk/mens/collaborations/engineered-garments" target="blank">through Barbours website</a></p>
